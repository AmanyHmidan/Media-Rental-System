This project is about a media rental system that keeps track of customers and media (movies ,music albums and games). It allows the customer to add to his cart whatever media he wants to rent, and then he can return them. The project utilizes the concept of inheritance in java by using superclass/subclass relationship. Moreover, JavaFx was used to create an interface for the system.
